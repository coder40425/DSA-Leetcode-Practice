/*  You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer k.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum average value and return this value. 
Any answer with a calculation error less than 10-5 will be accepted.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75000
Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75

Example 2:
Input: nums = [5], k = 1
Output: 5.00000                                              


##APPROACH:
-SLIDING WINDOW
  [IT BBASICALLY MEANS, KEEPING A WINDOW OF 'K' ELEMENTS AND WHEN YOU MOVE FORWARD, JUST SUBTRACT THE LEFTMOST ELEMENT OF THE SUBARRAY 
   AND ADD THE NEW RIGHTMOST ELEMENT.]
  [SUPPOSE, WE HAVE A ARRAY OF SIZE 6 (AS SHOWN IN EXAMPLE 1), K = 4, NOW ADD THE FIRST 4 ELEMENTS]
  [TO MOVE FORWARD, SUBTRACT THE FIRST ELEMENT AND ADD THE FIFTH ELEMENT (NOW THE SUM WILL BE OF THE NEXT 4 ELEMENTS AFTER THE FIRST INDEX)]
  [SIMILARLY, AGAIN SLIDE THE WINDOW BY SUBTRACTING SECOND ELEMENT AND ADDING SIXTH ELEMENT AND SO ON !]
  
-CALCULATE INITIAL WINDOW SUM (i.e. CALCULATE THE SUM OF FIRST 'K' INTEGERS)
-INITIALISE MAX SUM AND MAKE ( MAXSUM = WINDOW SUM)
-NOW SLIDE THE WINDOW AND STORE THE MAXIMUM VALUE,
-RETURN (DOUBLE) MAXSUM/K   (AS MAXIMUM AVERAGE SUM = TOTALSUM / SIZE OF ARRAY)
