### ðŸ§  Prerequisite Knowledge:
Before starting these problems, make sure you're comfortable with:

- Binary representation of integers
- Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
- Common bit manipulation tricks (checking if a number is power of 2, setting/unsetting/toggling bits)
- Understanding of subsets generation using bits (for problems like *Subsets*)
