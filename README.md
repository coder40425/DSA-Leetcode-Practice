# DSA Practice

# 🚀 DSA Practice – Summer 2025 (Target: 150+ Questions)

Hi, I'm **Yash Kumar Singh**, a 2nd-year Chemical Engineering undergrad from **NIT Durgapur (2024–2028)**.

This repository documents my summer vacation journey (May–July 2025) to solve 150+ *DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)* questions using *C++ on LeetCode*.

> It's a focused **10-week challenge** to level up problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve *150+ DSA problems* by July end  
- Master techniques like *sliding window, prefix sum, recursion, trees, graphs*, and more  
- Build interview-level confidence in core data structures and algorithms

---

## 📊 Current Progress

- ✅ *Problems Solved*: 109 (so far)  
- 🧠 *Current Focus*: Binary Search, Heaps & Priority Queue  
- 🔄 *Approach*: 2–3 problems/day with increasing difficulty
