# DSA Practice

DSA Practice – Summer 2025 (Target: 150 Questions)

Hi, I'm Yash Kumar Singh, a 2nd-year Chemical Engineering undergrad from NIT Durgapur (2024–2028).

This repository documents my summer vacation journey (May–July 2025) to solve 150+ DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) questions using C++ on LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/).
It's a focused 2-month challenge to level up my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.


---

🎯 Goals

Solve 150+ DSA problems by July end.

Master important techniques: sliding window, prefix sum, recursion, trees, graphs, etc.

Build interview-level confidence in key data structures and algorithms.



---

✅ Current Progress

Problems Solved: 52 (so far).

Currently Focused On: Trees + Stack & Queue.

Approach: 2-3 problems/day with increasing difficulty.
